## TO DO

* Fix colours of lines - need to remain consistent when deleting lines.
* Fix focus thing when a new line is created/removed and the chart is redrawn.
* Something that shows what dates are shown in focus area.
* Hover lines like on http://bl.ocks.org/gniemetz/4618602
* Rolling average. Configurable in UI?
* Points rather than dots? Gaps when there's no data?
* Filters:
	* Form for changing a line's filters.
	* Add map area filter?
* Resize width of chart on window resize?
* Demo site with dummy data.
* Permalinks?
* Remove require cache-busting in mappiness.js.
* Improve mappiness.dataManager's getNextColor() when colorPool runs out of colors.
