# Mappiness chart

Only tested in Chrome so far.

For charting data from the [Mappiness app](http://www.mappiness.org.uk/) (or
using semi-randomly-generated example data).


## Development

While developing, it's a pain to have to keep fetching your JSON data. So,
download your raw data as a JSON file using the data download link from the
app. 

Put your JSON file, named `mappiness.json`, in the same directory as this code
(at the same level as `index.html`).

Put the code on a webserver (it won't load the JSON file if run locally from a
`file://` URL).

Load `index.html`.
